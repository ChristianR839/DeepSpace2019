Objectives to be completed before MARCH 8

1) Movement valeus for parallel commands
2) Test vision (if Jackson has done his work properly)
3) Create encoder wires
    a) Wire encoders
4) Create limit switch wires
    a) Wire limit switches
5) Program limit switches
6) Program elevator presets
7) Get visual cameras running
    a) Practice driving with cameras only
8) Finalize controls
9) Try to remain calm during the next few weeks even though there
   will be a great deal of pressure put on me because I, along with
   everyone else, have an important job to do that is not yet
   completed and has to be done
