We have to get this robot done and bagged before midnight, and I can't be here for a bit
There are a few things that need to get done

1) Finalize the controls of the system itself
    There are other things that have to be done prior to this, such as step 4
    Basically, map out the system on paper first, and then in the code
    Make sure it feels good and is easy to understand

    As for the presets: We ARE using a controller instead of the numpad
    They will look like this (butons on the controller):

       0            0
    0     O      C     0
       0            0

    The circles with slashes (0) are where the six major presets are going to be,
    and then the seventh (cargo) will be at the "C"
    [Hatches on the left and balls on the right]

    All of those will be on the accessory controller


2) The vision system (with the Pixy) needs to be mounted and tested
    The 3D-printed case is somewhere (ask jason)
    It needs to be mounted with the correct ring light (preferably green)
    The location needs to be central and able to see the front accessory
    From there, work to tweak it and figure out what needs to be done


3) Data wires (for the encoders and limit switches) need to be put on the robot
    Make sure they are plugged into the correct Talons
    There are the following sensors:
        Encoders (maybe potentiometers)
        - Elevator (there is a bracket already there) [Talon 07]
        - Shoulder [Talon 03]
        - Wrist [Talon 10]
        Limit Switches
        - Bottom of elevator
        - Top of elevator


4) Automation of the movement of the accessory
    Make the elevator, shoudler, and wrist work together in movement
    This must be done so the operators don't have to be pressing 7 buttons at a time


Thank you for working on all this and I'll be back soon
