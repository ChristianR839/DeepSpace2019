Our team's code for the 2019 season

NOTE: These files will be changed and updated throughout the season and the final version will not be completed until after our last event

We use a 4-motor 6-wheel drop center drive train (kit)

Our accessory includes a single-motor shoulder mounted in the carriage in the elevator which moves an arm with our hatch panel manipulation device on the end of it which is a piston with two positions (in and out) that will grab and release hatch panels with ease.

**Thank you to Austin and Brent for helping us write these files**

To any other team who may be reading this, good luck this season!
